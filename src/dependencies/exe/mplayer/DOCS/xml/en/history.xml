<blockquote><para>
This began a year ago...  I have tried lots of players under Linux
(<application>mtv</application>, <application>xmps</application>,
<application>dvdview</application>, <application>livid/oms</application>,
<application>videolan</application>, <application>xine</application>,
<application>xanim</application>, <application>avifile</application>,
<application>xmmp</application>) but they all have some problem. Mostly with
special files or with audio/video sync. Most of them are unable to play both
MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and AVI (DivX) files. Many players have image quality or speed
problems too. So I've decided to write/modify one...

<para>
The first try, hacked together in a half hour!  I've used libmpeg3
from <ulink url="http://www.heroinewarrior.com"/> up to the version 0.3, but
there were image quality and speed problems with it.

MPEG codec replaced with DVDview by Dirk Farin, it was a
great stuff, but it was slow and was written in C++ (A'rpi hates C++!!!)

<para>
MPEG codec was libmpeg2 (mpeg2dec) by Aaron Holtzman and
Michel Lespinasse.  It's great, optimized very fast C code with perfect
image quality and 100% MPEG standard conformance.
