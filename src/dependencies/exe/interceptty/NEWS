Version 0.6-carminat
=====================
Added support for decoding CARMINAT CAN frames.

Version 0.6 (9/5/2004)
======================

Important fixes for running as root systems with /dev/ptmx!  Earlier
versions screwed up permissions on /dev/ptmx on some systems, making a
real mess.

Other features useful for running as root: Can now set permissions on
pty, and also chroot and switch UID/GID after opening devices.

If permissions are set on the pty, create a process to monitor
interceptty for exit, and when it finishes fix up permissions.  This
makes sure permissions get reset even if interceptty dies
unexpectedly, and also allows us to reset a pty owner even if we've
dropped privileges.  This isn't necessary on modern systems, but
doesn't hurt.

Version 0.5 (7/3/2004)
======================

Many portability fixes.  Lifted PTY code from OpenSSH.  Tested on RedHat
7.2, Fedora Core 2, Solaris 2.8, OpenBSD 2.9.  Should be portable to
all platforms OpenSSH is, although it may need some fixes.

Version 0.4 (6/27/2004)
=======================

Added all sorts of new backends, and some new frontends too, including
new VMWare compatability.  See the manpage for more information.

Added a manpage.

We don't poll when our first client goes away now.

Signal handling using sigaction, and should be more reliable.

Add some switches, to reduce the amount of output and print the
version.

Use -Wall compiler flags.


Version 0.3
===========
Fixed a problem with option parsing that prevented the 'front-device'
option from working.

Version 0.2b
============
Replaced accidental inclusion of an incorrect COPYING file.

Version 0.2
===========

Modified to use GNU autoconf.

Fixed a problem with option parsing that prevented '-t' from working.

Re-formatted the whole thing, converting from the ttysnoop-style to my
own preferred style.

Version 0.1b
===========
Fixed a compilation problem.

Version 0.1
===========
This is the first release.
