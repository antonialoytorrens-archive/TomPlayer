Overview of changes between 1.16.3 and 1.16.4
==============================================
- Add new configure option --disable-doc-cross-references and make
  sure releases are made using it.  Distributions are encouraged to
  build with --enable-gtk-doc such that their Pango docs correctly
  cross reference glib and cairo docs.
- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 432991 – developer docs for libpango are broken

Overview of changes between 1.16.2 and 1.16.3
==============================================
- Quantize kerning value if metrics hinting is on.  This greatly improves
  screen text rendering with certain fonts like DejaVu Sans.
  See: http://behdad.org/blog/mces/image/metricshinting-kerning.png
- Improved hex-box positioning in the cairo backend

Overview of changes between 1.16.1 and 1.16.2

- Misc build system fixes
- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 417946 – pangowin32-fontmap.c:using function without prototype
	Bug 419262 - Don't create coverage every time it's asked for

Overview of changes between 1.16.0 and 1.16.1
==============================================
- Improved Win32 backend: The Win32 backend has been
  updated to always require Uniscribe at compile-time (it still
  is optional at run-time), and to use the wide-character variants
  of Windows APIs which improves the backend in many ways.  The
  1.16.0 release is obsolete as far as the Win32 backend is
  concerned, and official DLLs were not built for it.
- Misc build system fixes
- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 110521 – can't find bold and/or italic fonts on win32
	Bug 120195 – there are some functions in pangowin32-fontmap.c that
		might maybe should be static
	Bug 407315 – Use wide character Win32 API in the pangowin32 code
	Bug 412654 – SED variable undefined in the `libtool --config' output
		used by configure
	Bug 414297 – Fails to build with --enable-static
		--with-included-modules in thai lang module
		Patch from Loïc Minier

Overview of changes between 1.15.6 and 1.16.0
==============================================
- Improved docs, with an object hierarchy and cross references to glib and
  cairo docs now (may require rebuilding the docs to correctly detect glib
  and cairo prefixes).
- Improved font selection for space characters
- Misc build system fixes
- Bugs fixed in this release:

- Respect FC_HINT_STYLE in the ft2 backend.  Patch has been in Fedora for ages.
- Require automake 1.9
Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 398238 – pangorc file missing from tests directory

Overview of changes between 1.15.3 and 1.15.4
==============================================
General:
- Finish vertical text support.
- Fix various bugs that could cause ellipsization to stop prematurely.
- Fix rendering of background color being off in presence of rise attribute.
- Improved text-on-path example (examples/cairotwisted.c)

Win32 Improvements:
- Don't check for X and don't warn about missing fontconfig. [Tor Lillqvist]
- Automatically use -mms-bitfields on Windows when building with gcc. [Tor]
- Update makefile.msv. [Hans Breuer]

Code base cleanups:
- Whitespace cleanups.  Hopefully patches still apply using patch -l
- Replace C++-style // comments with C-style /* */ ones.
- Move the pango-view tool from examples/ into pango-view/.  The examples/
  dir is still available and for simple examples only.

Public API changes:

- New PangoLayout query functions:

	pango_layout_is_wrapped()
	pango_layout_is_ellipsized()
	pango_layout_get_unknown_glyphs_count()

  The is_wrapped and is_ellipsized functions return whether the layout
  had to wrap/ellipsize any paragraphs, as opposed to the get_wrap and
  get_ellipsize that return the wrap/ellipsize mode set.

- Misc new function:
	pango_parse_enum()

  This is more a convenience function for internal use, but set public
  to go with other pango_parse_* functions.  Bindings should feel free
  to ignore this.


- New header files:

  Moved gravity and matrix stuff into their own header files pango-gravity.h
  and pango-matrix.h.  Both are included from pango-types.h.

- Vertical text:

  New attribute types:

	PANGO_ATTR_GRAVITY
	PANGO_ATTR_GRAVITY_HINT.

  New enum type:

	PangoGravityHint

  New macro:

	PANGO_GRAVITY_IS_VERTICAL()

  New public functions:

	pango_attr_gravity_new()
	pango_attr_gravity_hint_new()
	pango_gravity_hint_get_type
	pango_context_set_gravity_hint()
	pango_context_get_gravity_hint()
	pango_gravity_get_for_matrix()
	pango_gravity_get_for_script()

  Removed:
	pango_matrix_to_gravity()

  replaced by pango_gravity_get_for_matrix()
  
  Gravity API added in previous releases:

	PangoGravity
        pango_gravity_get_type
        pango_context_get_base_gravity
        pango_context_get_gravity
        pango_context_set_base_gravity
	pango_font_description_get_gravity
	pango_font_description_set_gravity
	pango_gravity_to_rotation

  A tip on using the vertical text support: If you just want to get correct
  behavior in rotated labels (say, vertical Chinese/Japanese, but rotated
  Latin, etc), all you need to do is to set the context gravity to
  PANGO_GRAVITY_AUTO.  You can do this for example

	#if defined(PANGO_VERSION_CHECK) && PANGO_VERSION_CHECK(1,15,4)
	  pango_context_set_gravity (context, PANGO_GRAVITY_AUTO);
	#endif

Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 395328 – Map kATSDeletedGlyphcode to PANGO_GLYPH_EMPTY
	Bug 397337 – Use is_ellipsized and is_wrapped to optimize property
		     changes
	Bug 328585 – Need to know if a layout has unknown glyphs
		     Patch from LingNing Zhang
	Bug 326693 – PangoLayouts should be query-able about their
		     effective properties (width / wrapped / ellipsized / etc)
	Bug 397327 – pango-layout.c: 'pango_layout_is_ellipsized' must return
		     a value
	Bug 323173 – Add layout of mixed direction text for vertical layout
	Bug 394453 – Use -mms-bitfields
	Bug 392628 – Don't check for X on win32


Overview of changes between 1.15.2 and 1.15.3
==============================================
- Fix Hangul crasher and other Hangul bugs introduced in 1.15.2
- Spell-checked docs
- Build fixes
- Don't introduce bitfields in public structs.  This changes some public API
  that was broken in the 1.15 series.  The new struct is backward compatible
  with the older Pango series, but not with earlier 1.15.x devel releases.

- New Public API:

  * PangoAnalysis.flags and PANGO_ANALYSIS_FLAGS_CENTERED_BASELINE.  These are
    mostly only useful for the vertical text support in Pango, but language
    bindings probably want to update their bindings for PangoAnalysis to
    include these.

  * New PangoMatrix methods:

	pango_matrix_transform_distance()
	pango_matrix_transform_point()
	pango_matrix_transform_rectangle()
	pango_matrix_transform_pixel_rectangle()

    The transform_rectangle methods are particularly useful when an
    app/toolkit wants to know the extents of a rotated layout in device
    coordinates.  It will be used by Gtk+ for example, and is used by the
    pango-view tool too.  The _pixel_ variant takes a PangoRectangle in device
    units instead of Pango units.

  * Unit conversion helpers:

	pango_units_from_double()
	pango_units_to_double()
	pango_extents_to_pixels()

    The first two just convert between Pango units (fixed precision) and
    double floating-point numbers.  The current implementations are as simple
    as "(int)floor (d * PANGO_SCALE + 0.5)" and "(double)i / PANGO_SCALE", but
    the idea is to have optimized versions of these that do not use the FPU in
    the future.  That will be appreciated by embedded devices without FPU
    units.  Since the functionality can be generally useful, the API is made
    public.

    The pango_extents_to_pixels() function in conjunction with
    pango_matrix_transform_rectangle() makes it possible to convert extents to
    device space and round then, instead of having to transform rounded
    user-space extents.

- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 351496 – PangoAnalysis::gravity breaks binary compatibility
	Bug 388702 – Crash when there's no Hangul glyph in the font.
	Bug 384543 – FcFontMatch misuse
	Bug 392789 – vpath build fails in basic module
		     Patch from J. Ali Harlow
	Bug 390877 – Don't feed pango-features.h to glib-mkenums
		     Patch from Yevgen Muntyan


Overview of changes between 1.15.1 and 1.15.2
==============================================
* Engines:
  - Improved Hangul shaper engine
  - Improved Indic shaper and language engines
  - Require libthai >= 0.1.7 for the Thai language engine

* Optimizations:
  - Avoid some floating-point operations.  Should cut the number of float
    ops per expose event in pangocairo to a half.
  - Cache ink and logical extents for PangoLayout

* New Public API:

  - New, generated, public header file pango-features.h.  Included by
    pango.h.  Currently contains the version information.  In the future,
    can be expanded to define which backends have been enabled, etc.

  - Public macros and functions for compile- and run-time version checking:

	PANGO_VERSION_ENCODE()
	PANGO_VERSION_MAJOR
	PANGO_VERSION_MINOR
	PANGO_VERSION_MICRO
	PANGO_VERSION
	PANGO_VERSION_STRING
	PANGO_VERSION_CHECK()
	pango_version()
	pango_version_string()
	pango_version_check()

    The scheme chosen here is a mixture of approaches taken by glib and cairo.
    The advantage over the glib model is that there are no public variables,
    but it still gives access to a string and numerical representation of the
    version number at compile- and run-time.
    
    The macros enable conditional compilation of code depending on newer Pango
    APIs, while the runtime functions allow refusing to run against old
    versions of the library.

  - New, readonly, version of methods that give read/write access to the
    internals of PangoLayout:

	pango_layout_get_line_readonly()
	pango_layout_get_lines_readonly()
	pango_layout_iter_get_line_readonly()
	pango_layout_iter_get_run_readonly()

    These should be used when you do not intend to modify the run/line,
    which is most of the time the case.  The only exception known to me
    is Firefox that adjusts glyph widths to do justification.  Most other
    uses that do not write to the returned structs (or structs accessible from
    them) should be ported to the new readonly API to benefit from major
    optimizations (in this case, line extents caching).  The list includes,
    but is not limited to, Gtk+, SWT, ClassPath, gnome-applets, libgnomeprint,
    xmlroff, GtkMathView, Conglomerate, Dia, Anjuta, wxWindows, The Gimp, 
    and various other applications/libraries:

      http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&q=+pango_layout_(iter_)%3Fget_(lines%3F%7Crun)%5B%5E_%5D&start=50&sa=N

    Worth noting here is that, many uses of pango_layout_get_lines() can be
    replaced by a pango_layout_get_iter() that works both more elegantly and
    more efficiently.  The versioning macros introduced in this release can be
    used to make code use these new symbols without breaking compilation
    against older Pango (though, such code compiled with the new Pango cannot
    be run against an older Pango).

  - pango_language_get_default(): Note that, this does not make Pango
    fallback to the default language automatically (yet), but the user can
    use this function to set the default language of the locale on a context:

	  pango_context_set_language (context, pango_language_get_default());

    This essentially deprecates gtk_get_default_language().  The pango-view
    tool has been updated to use this feature, so it now respects $LANG when
    choosing fonts.

  - pango_color_to_string().

* Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 326099 – Setting width, indentation and ellipsizing doesn't work
		     as I would expect
	Bug 385478 – Fix tests on OPD platform
	Bug 319808 – Patch to let pango support artifical italic, bold and
		     bold italic styles for the fonts which don't have these styles.
		     Patch from James Su
	Bug 385321 – Worst case expansion for Sinhala
		     Patch from Harshula
	Red Hat Bug 211574: [hi/ml/si_LK] cursor naviation is wrong when
		     using ZWJ (200d)
		     Patch from LingNing Zhang
	Red Hat Bug 216424: [te_IN] pango - consonant + dependent vowel (ai)
		     Composed char is not rendering properly
		     Patch from LingNing Zhang
	Bug 373856 – Wish: Function to convert a GdkColor to a string
		     Patch from Matthew Barnes
	Red Hat Bug 216850: Issue in combination with vowels (ml_IN)
		     Patch from LingNing Zhang
	Bug 382437 – tests/testboundaries fails
	Bug 333982 – Fallback to $LANG whenever NULL PangoLanguage is used
		     Patch from LingNing Zhang

Overview of changes between 1.15.0 and 1.15.1
==============================================
* Add Thai langauage engine. (currently makes tests/testboundary fail.)
* Add Lao and improved Thai sample text.
* Improved Indic module.
* Output correct path for hexboxes in pango_cairo_layout_path().
* Implement get_resolution method for the FT2 fontmap.  Shouldn't make
  any difference whatsoever.  Open a bug if it does.
* Misc small fixes.

* Optimizations:
  - Rework PangoLayout algorithms to avoid calling a recursive call to
    pango_layout_get_extents().  Avoids one pango_font_get_glyph_extents()
    call per glyph per layout rendering.  We now make 2 such calls.
  - Don't cache run_logical_rect in PangoLayoutIter.
    Avoids one pango_font_get_glyph_extents() call per glyph per layout
    rendering.  We are down to 1 now.
  - Cache line extents.  This avoids the final pango_font_get_glyph_extents()
    call per glyph per layout rendering.  Now we don't make any
    pango_font_get_glyph_extents() calls when rendering a layout (some
    conditions apply)!
  - Replace PANGO_IS_RENDERER with PANGO_IS_RENDERER_FAST for most
    internal uses, that is, just a NULL-check.
  - Use simple, fast, casts instead of PANGO_CAIRO_*() macros where the
    object cannot have reached us if it wasn't of the right type.

  Pango module version, meaning that modules compiled against earlier
  versions are probably not compatible with this release. [#73147]
