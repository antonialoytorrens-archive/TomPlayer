# TomPlayer
From https://sourceforge.net/projects/tomplayer/ . Migrated to Git. Project by srafin (Stephan Rafin).

A multimedia player for tomtom GPS.

Tested on my TomTom ONE v8. Later versions work but has a LOT of memory limitations, because it has 30 MB of RAM only.
Recommended version is v0.220. If you use internal memory (like me), please remove `ttsystem` from the zip release file, or download the corresponding `-INTERNAL` release.

Please place the contents inside `distrib` folder into your ROOT of the TomTom.
If you use external SD Card, please also place `ttsystem` inside it.

The patches folder contains an updated initial splash screen (optional), because I found unintuitive tapping the screen to enter the program at first. Despite of that, I've put a more clarifying subtitle to this initial splash screen.
